/**
 * Sidebar menu — kept **in onboarding order**: my character → connection → employees → office.
 *
 * This order is exactly the path a new user walks. **"Me" is made first** (without a character,
 * the office screen redirects to the character screen — the redirect in
 * `src/app/channels/page.tsx`). Then the Hermes gateway is connected, an employee is created and
 * the model is logged in as that employee, and finally an office is created and occupied. The
 * old menu had its order scattered and had no `my character` at all.
 *
 * `AI provider` (`/providers`) was dropped because it's a pre-Hermes screen — Hermes manages
 * provider auth on its own, per profile. Clicking it doesn't connect to this product's flow and
 * misleads the user.
